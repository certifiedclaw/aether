"""
core/loop_guard.py — Aether Loop Guard
Ported from OpenAether agents/loop_guard.py, adapted for flat architecture.

Detects when the LLM is stuck calling the same tool with the same args in a loop
and breaks the cycle by injecting a hard stop or forcing a different approach.

Usage in main.py _process_message:
    from core.loop_guard import LoopGuard
    guard = LoopGuard(max_repeats=2, window=4)
    # in tool call loop:
    if guard.check(tool_name, tool_args):
        break  # loop detected, stop
    guard.record(tool_name, tool_args)
